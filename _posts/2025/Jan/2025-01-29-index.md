I implemented a concurrent map for a statistics endpoint at work over the last few months and regrettably I was punching outside my weight class. It did work but I could not confidently tell you what the code did altogether, future problems might be hard for me to solve. I made it my mission to start learning about Java concurrency to it's fullest, completing courses and practise problems to improve my technical skill in this area. Already, three days in, I have learned more than I did over the last three years as a developer. 

The first task I decided to accomplish was a quick 5 hour Java concurrency class provided through my work's training portal. The work was pretty basic but an hour in we got an assignment: create a concurrent program to sum all the elements of an array. I added the extra parameter that this must be done inline without modifying the original array or creating a new one. Naturally I first wrote a recursive function which received the array, a start, and an end index, and conducted a merge-sort-like fork through the array and joining as I stepped back up the recursion tree.
```
getSum(int[] input, int start, int end) {
    if (end - start == 0) {
        return input[start];
    }
    if (end - start == 1) {
        return input[start] + input[end];
    }
    
    int half = (end + start) / 2;
    return getSum(input, start, half) + getSum(input, half + 1, end);
}
```
This is easy and should be expected from anyone who knows anything about java. It is more performant than a for-loop with incremental addition, but you do run the risk of exceeding recursion depth if done incorrectly. Switching this to a concurrent model seemed easy enough, I would just create an ExecutorService in my class and execute each getSum as a new thread. 
```
ExecutorService e = 
	Executors.newFixedThreadPool(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
...
    int half = (end + start) / 2;
    Future<Integer> left = e.submit(() -> getSumFast(input, start, half));
    Future<Integer> right = e.submit(() -> getSumFast(input, half + 1, end));
    return left.get() + right.get();
}
```
But this is where I hit a snag, the method was stalling infinitely. I assumed correctly that I was running out of threads as each recursive call spawns two new threads and blocks until they are done. I did something similar in my team product, but if I had implemented this incorrectly and stalled the app every time my endpoint was called I would be in big trouble without the skill to fix it. 
\
&emsp; After some research I figured our that I just needed to change my thread pool type to `Executors.newWorkStealingPool()`. This will turn my executor service into a fork-join pool, which is optimized for concurrent recursion. The idea is that if a thread is idle or stopped it will start tasks from another thread's work pool. With this, once the thread was idle waiting for the `left.get()` and `right.get()` it would take on the `left.get()` or `right.get()` of it's sibling thread removing the deadlock completely. This also reduces the amount of cores used to the amount available in your system (I could have stuck with the `newFixedThreadPool` pool and just set to 1000 threads but that is not dynamic nor efficient). Reading into it further I can see that the only time it is not a good idea to use the fork-join pool is when you are in an app server, since the fork-join pool uses a common pool of threads and could steal CPU time from incoming requests. Overall this was a good learning experience.

I wanted to take this a little further and ask ChatGPT for some concurrency-related interview questions. Here are a few I didn't immediately get:

### What happens if you call start() on a thread that has already been started?

Seems simple enough to test. What happens is the call will throw an exception since you cannot run `start()` on a thread that isn't in `NEW` state.
As a side note here, I should try to remember all the thread states: NEW, RUNNABLE, TIMED_WAITING, WAITING, BLOCKED, TERMINATED.

### What is thread safety? How can you ensure thread safety in Java?

I know about synchronized methods but if I were in an interview this wouldn't be enough to satisfy the question. I looked into this and it turns out there are a whole class of thread safety techniques in Java:
- Synchronized methods, where only one thread at a time can enter the method
- `ReentrantLock ` which is more flexible than synchronized allowing you to lock and unlock at specific points in the program
- Atomic variables, which are like synchronized methods but control and synchronize the modifications on a single variable
- Thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMaps, which have more memory overhead but allow concurrent operations on them
- Immutable objects, adding `final` to variables to ensure threads do not modify the values
- The `ThreadLocal` object which allows variables to be isolated within each thread (each thread has their own copy)
- Executor framework, for managing thread pools, which I did know about

### What is a volatile variable in Java?

Volatile fields prevent caching of a value, telling the thread to go straight to memory for the value. This allows threads to always have an up-to-date version of a field allowing it to change without affecting visibility. This is not thread-safe altogether though since modifications of the variable within the threads are prone to race conditions. 


I will continue to learn more about Java concurrency and become a better Java developer from it.
