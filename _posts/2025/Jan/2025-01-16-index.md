I asked ChatGPT for some Java interview questions, just to ensure that I keep my skills within reach, and I was surprised to see three core java questions that I couldn't confidently answer. The good thing is, ChatGPT asked them, not a real interviewer, and so I can look into them now!

### First: What are the major differences between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java? When would you use one over the other?

This question tripped me up because my first instinct is to say an array list does not keep order and a linked list does, but that's not true. I am mistaking these data structures for a Set. Both array list and linked list are List objects that keep order, but they work differently underneath the hood, and can be used for different scenarios.
\
&emsp; I'll start explaining LinkedList since it is more complicated. It has a higher memory overhead since it stores two pointers per node in the list: `prev` and `next`, and so Java keeps a doubly linked list as it's internal implementation (as oppose to a singly linked list with just a `next`). LinkedList inserts elements anywhere in the list at constant time O(1), but a retrieval time of O(n), since it needs to traverse through the nodes to find the element. This makes it a great choice for when you are adding many objects to the array without searching for them often.
\
&emsp; Whereas, an array list is not a linked list at all, it is a dynamic array, which means it can automatically expand in size as more elements are added. This means that insertions to the array can take linear O(n) time if the array needs to expand in size, with the edge case of amortized constant time O(1) if the element is added to the end of the array without resize. Though, retrieval is constant time, so this makes an ArrayList better if you are retrieving many elements in the array without so many additions.
\
&emsp; So we can see that the two different list types are inverse to each other, one for better access and one for better insertion/deletion. This is interesting to me because when we learn about Java in school and in YouTube videos you don't often see LinkedList. Linked lists were taught to me in my systems programming course when we were learning C, since this concept requires you to understand memory. This is probably to simplify the learning process without worrying too much about performance optimization. 

### Second: How does the `equals()` and `hashCode()` contract work in Java? Why is it important?

This one upset me, since I should know what this is. Whenever I am creating a new Java class and override the `equals()` method, the IDE will prompt me to also override the `hashCode()` method, but I guess I never really understood why.
\
&emsp; The reason is because the `hashCode()` method is used all over java, such as HashMaps when the code needs to find a bucket to insert the object into. If `hashCode()` is not overridden then there is risk of duplication. The idea is that if you need to specify how an object is compared to other instantiations of itself then you need to specify the hash code. All objects that are equal should have the same hash, but not all objects that have the same hash are necessarily equal. And so the two need to be specified in order to interact predictably with the code. 

### Third: What are checked and unchecked exceptions in Java? When should you use each?

This is another one that frustrates me, because I know exactly what this is but I couldn't formulate into words when I should use either exception. A checked exception requires a try-catch block to wrap it, or a throws in the method header, whereas an unchecked exception requires no special logic to handle it. 
\
&emsp; The simple answer is that checked exceptions should be used for recoverable situations and unchecked exceptions should be used for programming errors when the user has a flaw in their logic. 

Clearly there is still a lot for me to learn and understand if I ever need to pass a Java interview in the future. Sometimes I think I know something but then I can't exactly find the words to describe it to an interviewer. This is somewhat ironic, as I just finished a [post on Plato's Meno](/books/2025/01/14/index.html), where we learn that when a teacher leads a student to unlearn something that they were previously confident in, it makes them better, not worse, since the student is now closer to the truth (or the form). 

> I made key grammer edits to this post after sending the last sentence to ChatGPT for marking. I want to become a better writer, and getting grammer tips from ai is one way to do that. Here is what the sentance was before my edit:
> "This is kind of ironic, as I just finished a post on Plato's Meno, where we learn that when a teacher makes a student unlearn something that they were previously confident on it makes them better, not worse, since the student is now closer to the truth (or form). "
> The edits made were:
> - reword "kind of" to "somewhat", which sounds more formal
> - reword "confident on" to "confident in", for the correct preposition. Added comma after as well.
> - reword "makes a student unlearn" to "leads a student to unlearn", for more natural phrasing
> - reword "(or form)" to "(or the form)", a more accurate reference to the philosophy
