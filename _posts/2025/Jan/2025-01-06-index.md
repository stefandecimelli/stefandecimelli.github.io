  synopsis="A lone astronaut. An impossible mission. An ally he never imagined. Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission - and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company. His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it's up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery-and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species. And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he's got to do it all alone. Or does he?"

Great book. I think I can recommend this to anyone, especially if they would like to dip their toes into sci-fi and don't want the dreaded Dune treatment. In terms of sci-fi, this is kind of like listening to Foo Fighters whereas Dune is like listening to Tool. I personally like Dune but I cannot recommend that book like I can with Project Hail Mary. They're not even comparable, and makes me doubt if sci-fi is too broad a term to even use here. 

I liked all the dad humour, personally, because it was the exact right amount of cheesiness. I genuinely laughed at some of the jokes here, and it gave the narrative an overall uplifting feel. The simple and un-stylistic writing made the pages fly by and I rarely needed to go back and reread a sentence or paragraph. 

All the math and science was super cool and very nerd friendly but definitely not dumbed down. I can tell that Andy Weir didn't just do his research into making the math and science make sense but also that he has a great interest in it. 

I would love to point out plot holes like the online book community does but I really don't have anything substantial. I think I can come up with a reason to argue every single plot point you can think of, or at least suspend my disbelief at others. It is a book after all, and I think it did it's job in the realism department given the fictional content.

One last note on the edition, as I will always do in my reviews. The books was a great size and had floppy pages. The reading experience was completely ideal.
