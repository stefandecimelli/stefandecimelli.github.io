Yearly I try to read about 30 books. In 2022 I read 30 exactly, but last year I only read 13 books (excluding Plato).
This is my commitment. New year, hard goal.

I also wanted to try out this new widget. It'll be cool to add it to the books post in 2025. The code to do the above is easy. 
I made an includes html file and now I can do (removing the `\`'s before the `%`'s):
```
{\% include reading_challenge.html 
  books_read=5
  goal=30
  year=2025
  progress_percentage=0
  challenge_url="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/57704755"
\%}
```
I just need to get the challenge url from GoodReads and put the icon image in the folder `assets/images/goodreads2025goal.jpg` with the year in the file name.

| (update, Sept 30, 2025) As of a few months ago, I no longer use GoodReads, so the format of this post will be a little different. GoodReads was instilling this idea that I needed to 'rate' books, which I no longer belived I need to do (more on that thought [here](/thoughts/2025/09/30/index/)). Instead, I will just append the list of posts to this post everytime I finish a book. I have deleted the reading_challenge widget.

The average size of the books I read last year was about 469 pages. 
I think if I can read 500 pages per week this year I can get over 30 books read, closer to 45-50 even. That would be cool!
