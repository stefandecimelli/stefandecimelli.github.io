For my birthday I was gifted front row platinum seats to the Leafs game against the Vancouver Canucks. I had never been even below the 300 level at Scotiabank arena so this was a big deal for me, and I was super appreciative to get the opportunity. The platinum seats get a bunch of perks, like a secret entrance, and a better food counter. The prime rib sandwiches were insanely good and almost out of place to carry into the hockey arena. I had to make sure I didn't get any stains on my nice #88 St. Pat's jersey. When all the players came out to practise I got to see them super up close, within a few meters of us.

Sounds like a fun time right? Well, you may have forgotten one thing: the Leafs will disappoint you at any opportunity. The final score of the game was 3-0 for Vancouver, and we looked terrible the entire game. All I wanted to see was an Auston Matthews goal in person but I barely even saw an Auston Matthews pass in person. The only guy worth seeing on the entire team was Nick Robertson and that buy is playing for his life right now. 

I am sorely disappointed. I have never been to a good Leaf's game. The last game I went to was the final game of the Leafs-Panthers 2022 playoffs round 2 series, where the Leafs lost game 5 and Radko Gudas scream cheered into rookie goaltender Joseph Woll's face. The ending to that game was an insane bubble burst of disappointment. The game I went to before that was when we blew a 3-0 lead against the dying Arizona Coyotes. We booed the team off the ice.

The Leafs ruin everything. Hell, game 1 of your new Superstar Auston Matthew's career where he tallies 4 goals in one game, his first game ever, we lose to Ottawa in overtime 5-4. I watched that live from my university dorm room. 

The silver lining is that I got to see two of the three Canucks goals right up agains the glass. They have a good team this year, and their captain Quinn Hughes is amazing in person. Maybe they'll even win the cup and finally be the team to bring it home for a Canadian franchise. It's crazy that that's a crazy dream. The Leafs wont win the cup this year, that's that.
