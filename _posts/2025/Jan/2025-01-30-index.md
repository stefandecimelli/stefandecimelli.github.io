Sometimes a game like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim comes along that is so good that I play it almost every two years since it came out. Some games are infinitely repayable by design, like Balatro or The Binding of Isaac. But there are some games that are so perfect in their execution and sit so pristine in my memory that I fear that playing them again will ruin the perfect image I keep from that experience (that's right, the title was clickbait, gotta stay on your toes around here). 

In constructing this list of games I realized that they all had some similarities. First, most of them allowed slow-walking role playing. Have you ever drove slowly within the street lines in Grand Theft Auto? That's what I mean, but instead of stopping at traffic lights I enjoy slow walking as my character through fantasy worlds. Second, I like a little splash of horror in what I play. That does not necessarily mean I like horror games, but whenever I watch a movie, tv show, read a book, or play a game, I enjoy minor well-done horror elements throughout. Thirdly, I really like a story with good characters, and especially one where my choices can matter and affect those characters. It brings me back to reading choose-your-own-adventure books from the Scholastic bookfairs in elementary school. Lastly, I like puzzle solving. Most games do have puzzle solving but when it's good you can really identify it. 

Here's my list in full, and I will explain what each game brings from the points above:

### 8. Dragon Age Inquisition

Going through this games was great because of it's large expansive world and great characters. The best memory I have of this game though is the post-game content where you sit on a throne in a fort you build, surrounded by the characters you have built relationships with, and make judgement on the enemy characters you previously met in the story. Every decision made comes together in this mission, and you see the repercussions of your actions through the state of the characters you are to judge. Then, you decide what to do with certain characters brought to trial; throw them in prison, banish them, execute them, etc. The best one was when the 'remains' of a character that I previously killed in the story were brought to trial in a box. I made the silly decision to imprison the character, meaning the box would sit in a cell in the dungeons for the rest of the game. That alone is enough to cement this game in my good memories.

### 7. Resident Evil

I played the 'remake' version released in 2002 for the GameCube. It was old, yes, but something clicked in the weekend that I played it, and I played through the entire 12 hour story in that one weekend. The horror and puzzle solving hit me exactly right in the exact right moment in my life. I will never forget the shark pool in the lab.

### 6. Death Stranding

This game takes slow-walking to another level, since it's actually a mechanic in the game. I don't think I've ever felt ambiance like this in a game before. Sometimes you will be slow-walking to your destination in the story and a song by Lour Roar will start playing in the background at the exact right moment and then you realize you are in this surreal and beautiful world. You start to play the game slow and steady and then suddenly life is peaceful, and slow and steady. I can't wait to try Death Stranding 2 this year.

### 5. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt 

This game combines a lot of what I love. Geralt was an amazing character that I loved to role play as, and slow trot with my horse through the world in. The spooky horror elements were sprinkled perfectly and the choices made along the way gave you one of multiple endings that all felt different. There are so many memorable missions throughout, like the Bloody Baron mission, but I think the most memorable part of this game was getting to the big city of Novigrad and walking through the busy streets. There were so many characters walking about with such large buildings, and I had never  seen anything like it before that (recall that Skyrim was my standard at the time).

### 4. God of War

When I moved into my own rental place after university I finally purchased a PS4. I was super late to the party since I chose to focus on my studies up until then, and so I was late to get to a large catalog of games. The first game I wanted to buy was God of War, which was 50% off at the time. I remember completing all the platforming puzzles, exploring the hand crafted world, and slow canoeing through the hub world while Mimir told stories of Norse mythology in the background. I have a deep nostalgia for this time, living alone, buying Indian food, and recording guitar solos on my MacBook. I have a hard time even playing the sequel because the first game was so perfect. Another game from this period of my life was **Horizon: Zero Dawn** which shares some of that nostalgia, an honourable mention on this list.

### 3. Alan Wake II

Strangely, this is the first and only PS5 game on this list. Alan Wake was a perfect story game for me, with great characters and a spooky story. It set a new standard for me for atmospheric storytelling and video game writing as a whole. I was so excited to play this game that I played through the first Alan Wake immediately after preordering Alan Wake II. I was also in a Stephen King phase at that time so I was already ingrained in that vibe.

### 2. Mass Effect 2

I considered putting this game first, but the game in first absolutely deserves to be there. The Mass Effect trilogy was a PS3 franchise that I missed out on for some reason, so I played through it as the Legendary Edition when I got my PS4. I played through all of Mass Effect 1 and even played it again later on to 100% it. Mass Effect 1 was good, but Mass Effect 2 is one of the best games ever made. The main point here is that the characters are all so good, and I developed an emotional attachment to all of them. But, in the last level, when you go into enemy territory with this large group of all these characters you are attached to, they start dropping like flies. Your own decisions along the way, and decisions in the last level (ex. telling the wrong person to stay behind and hold the door) will impact the life of every single one of them. I saw my own poor decisions kill my favourite chatacters in that level, and that elicited a real response from me. It is crazy enough when a character you really like dies, but when it's due to your own poor decision it makes the impact so much worse. What I found super cool was that when you went to play Mass Effect 3 (which was pretty good) the decisions you made carry over, and those characters that died in the last level don't come back. Games like that just aren't made anymore, making this one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had.

### 1. Red Dead Redemption 2

Speaking of emotional endings, I cried real tears when this game ended. Arthur is one of the best characters in all of gaming and his sendoff at the end of the game was unbelievable. The character was so well written throughout the story that I felt like I knew him. I would slow pace my horse to explore the world, camping and hunting for food, pretending to be him. Not to mention Dutch, the grey-area antagonist of the story, was so deep and thought provoking that I still think about his relationship with Arthur to this day. Even now, I am reading a western novel called Lonesome Dove and I can't help but picture Arthur as these characters I am reading. This is my favourite all time game and I never want to play it again, so it stays like that.

It gets harder and harder to find games this good these days. It's crazy to think only one modern game made it to this list, the rest being from once or two generations ago. That could be a show to the weakness of this console generation, or maybe I just need to give some games more time in my memory to crystalize into nostalgia.
