title: Ship of Magic
author: Robin Hobb
synopsis: |
  From the author of the classic Farseer trilogy, Ship of Magic begins an epic tale of pirates, sentient ships, magic, sea serpents, slave revolts, dashing heroes and bloody battles. On the northernmost point of the Cursed Shores lies Bingtown, a bustling hub of exotic trade and home to a proud merchant nobility famed for its extraordinary vessels. Only Bingtown liveships can negotiate the perilous waters of the Rain Wild River and plunder the riches found upstream, but such vessels are made from the most precious commodity in the world – a material with the ability to become sentient – and so are extremely rare. The fortunes of one of Bingtown’s oldest families rest on the newly awakened liveship Vivacia. For Althea Vestrit, the ship is her rightful legacy. But the fate of Vivacia – and the Vestrits – may ultimately lie in the hands of the dark and charming pirate, Kennit, who lusts after such a ship and has plans of his own...

I actually completed this book back in October 2024, but I want to include it here in my blog.

Robin Hobb is an insane writer. Her stories and characters as so good, which is what keeps you along for the ride.
My main gripe with this book is the slow pace, which is my issue with all of Robin's book.
The endings to her books are always worth it and the memories of her characters will stay with you.
That makes the book totally worth it.
But holy crap it takes a while to get there. Delayed gratitute.

The setting and fantasy elements here are super unique.
I can't think of anything else that has this weirdo unique character of a talking boatmast.
It borders on too strange for me even, and I'm sure this would be a hard character to take in for new readers to fantasy who may not be expecting something that strange. 

This series is the second trilogy in her fantasy series, the first I already read.
This trilogy has new characters which I didn't mind. 
The thing is, I know Robin is capable of creating an epic trology so I'm here for the ride.
We're starting off slow but I expect big things from the next two books in the series.

As a side note, I love this new look format for the books reviews.
GoodReads will give you a code snipped in your review page that says "Copy/paste the text below into your blog".
So I'm gonna try to do my book reviews like this going forward.
