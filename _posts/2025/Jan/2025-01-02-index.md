	My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6398682003">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

	I actually completed this book back in October 2024, but I want to include it here in my blog.
<br/><br/>
	Robin Hobb is an insane writer. Her stories and characters as so good, which is what keeps you along for the ride.
	My main issue with this book is the slow pace, which is my issue with all of Robin's book.
	The endinds to her books are always worth it and the memories of her characters will stay with you.
	That makes the book totally worth it.
	But holy crap it takes a while to get there. Delayed gratitute.

For the synopsis I'm just going to copy-paste what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Magic) says:
> Setting. A liveship is a ship made of Wizardwood, a mystical substance from up the Rain Wild River. When three generations of a ship's owners die on board, a liveship "quickens", becoming a sentient being with a personality, the memories of the dead ancestors, and a psychic connection to living family members.

The setting and fantasy elements here are super unique.
I can't think of anything else that has this weirdo unique character of a talking boatmast.
It borders on too strange for me even, and I'm sure this would be a hard character to take in for new readers to fantasy who may not be expecting something that strange. 

This series is the second trilogy in her fantasy series, the first I already read.
This trilogy has new characters which I didn't mind. 
The thing is, I know Robin is capable of creating an epic trology so I'm here for the ride.
We're starting off slow but I expect big things from the next two books in the series.

As a side note, I love this new look format for the books reviews.
GoodReads will give you a code snipped in your review page that says "Copy/paste the text below into your blog".
So I'm gonna try to do my book reviews like this going forward.
