Yakuza (or, Like a Dragon, Japanese: 龍が如く, Hepburn: Ryū ga Gotoku) as a franchise is bad and good. Actually, the words I would best use are terrible and amazing. I have never been so entertained, confused, frustrated, and weirded out by a series so consistently. I have played four games now in this franchise and if I am being honest with myself I am going to be playing more of them. I am hooked on this weird game loop, it's amazing characters and story, and even the hundreds of minigames throughout the whole series. I'll recount here the games I've played so far and why I hate and love them.

### Judgement 

When this game became a free download on PlayStation Plus I installed it without thinking or knowing what this game was about. All I saw were good reviews on all the review platforms, and I was in the mood to play a Japanese video game at that moment. Woah boy, I could not predict the trajectory this game put me on when I first played it. It seemed initially like a detective game where you solve murder cases in a crime-ridden city. In fact, I had no idea that this game was even connected with the Yakuza series, and I wasn't really all that familiar with the series in a whole.

&emsp; One thing people get wrong about this series is how they might think it's just Grand Theft Auto in Japan. While it is technically an open world game about crime this couldn't be further from the truth. The open worlds in these games are actually more alike to small hub maps where you get from story, to side mission, to minigame. There's not actually things to explore and do within the map, and there's certainly no driving involved. Waves of enemies will encounter you in the streets and you either fight them with your bare hands or try to run away. 
\
&emsp; Judgement has a high stakes story and fine characters, but I felt like it went on a little to much in the end, and I found myself skipping cutscenes. This is a mistake some people make when playing these games, since it does feel like the game is just cutscene, fight some guys, cutscene, fight some guys, and so on. You might think to yourself 'I don't even care about the story anymore, let's just get to the next fight and skip these long cutscenes'. But the whole point of these games is to experience all it has to offer as a complete whole. Each individual aspect of it is a little mediocre if I had to tell the truth, but when combined it's just works and it's super addicting. You can't compare one aspect of these games with any other game, it just won't be fair.
\
&emsp; The story is super goofy and had a good payoff. I did enjoy my experience with it but I came out of it being very confused, like this game was a prank being played on me. Turns out, yeah, if you didn't have context about what these games are all about then you're going to feel the same as I did.

### Yakuza: Like a Dragon

Another game that became free to install on PlayStation Plus, and I decided that I would try a 'mainline' Yakuza game, liking Judgement as much as I did. Turns out, I made another mistake. This game was a bit of a rebrand for the series, changing from the button-mashing brawler style fighter to a turn based combat style fighting. I was taken off guard from this because I read online that this was a new set of characters and I didn't need to play the older games to enjoy this one. (The name itself implies the rebrand too, moving away from the 'Yakuza' name and going towards the Japanese name 'Like A Dragon'. Newer games in this franchise forgo the title 'Yakuza' altogether).

&emsp; This game was even goofier than Judgement, with a less serious tone and lead character. I found myself in some ridiculous situations, like finding zany characters to summon like pokemon in the middle of battle, or the baby side mission (look it up). But one thing did catch my eye too, the map was the exact same as Judgement. Every street and alley was the exact same layout, and named the same. Apparently this is a theme across all the games. The map stays the same. Again, if you take this as it is, it's somewhat mediocre, but when you look at the series as a whole you realize that this is intentional and a way for the player to identify how the setting is changing over time. You might see a building you used to shop at in an earlier game and now it's boarded up in a sequel. It works as a part of a whole piece. 
\
&emsp; I didn't end up finishing this game, since the story was so long, but I can see myself coming back to it and giving it another chance.

### Yakuza 0, and Yakuza Kiwami

This year I finally took the plunge into the mainline series. Yakuza 0 was a prequel game made with a new engine for PlayStation 4 (oh yeah, these two games are originally PS2 and PS3 games) and the reception online is that this is a great place to start. Yakuza Kiwami (meaning 'extreme') is a remake of the original first Yakuza with the same new engine used to create Yakuza 0. Both games have the same graphics, animations, fighting style, characters, and map as each other, so I am taking them as two parts of a whole. The story takes place first in the 80's and then 17 years later in the 90's, as the leading main character Kiryu. 
\
&emsp; I loved these games. They were addicting and the story was gripping all the way through. Kiryu is a very serious -- almost Batman-y character -- who gets himself wrapped up in intense gang moments, but also silly still like his encounters with rival Majima, and minigames like karaoke and fishing. The combat was simple but satisfying to play.

&emsp; I was put off though by the creepy pervy nature of some of the minigames in these two games. I learned about a Japanese underworld venue called a Cabaret Club where wealthy people would go to a lounge type area to talk to beautiful women who goad them into buying more drinks and racking up a bill. This in itself was a little creepy for me, but then there's also the side missions where if you develop a relationship with a cabaret club girl it will show you a 'heated moment' with them... which is a nearly softcore porn video of a real woman resembling this character. I was creeped out. There are also 'bikini bars' the character goes to to watch pole dancers, and 'telephone clubs' where Kiryu can flirt with strangers on the phone. I think the worst of all though is in Yakuza 0, where you can collect these 'softcore' videos which is almost straight up a porn library. I am really annoyed and embarrassed when stuff like this comes on the screen and I am thankful my partner didn't walk in on me playing it.

I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the completion percentage of these games. They are infamous for having the most grueling and grinding achievements to get 100% completion, such as playing every mini game many times and doing every side mission. I have seen walkthroughs where it can take up to 150 hours for a single game to be 100%-ed. While I like spending some time completing the games I play to 100% I am not going to waste my time with that. I got to 50% completion for each game which I am satisfied with.

### Yakuza Kiwami 2, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life

These game I opened once and promptly deleted. They remade the engine once more to support better graphics for the PlayStation 4, but the game is locked at 30fps. I cannot play a game locked at 30fps. The last one I did play was Bloodborne and that was an exception, but these days it is far too jittery and noticeable to play a game under 60fps. On top of that the first level of Yakuza 2 had performance issues so the FPS was even worse. I saw online that Yakuza 6 was made with the same engine, so I won't be playing these games unless they made a PS5 version of them like they did with Judgement. 

As for the rest of the series, Yakuza 3-5, I heard they have their own gameplay problems that make playing them a bit more of a chore. I heard the nickname for Yakuza 3 is "Blockuza" since every enemy blocks your hits so aggressively, which doesn't sound fun to me. I am more interested now in the newer entries: "Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth", the sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, and "Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name", the next 'Kiryu' entry. It seems like these games come out every year, either a mainline or a spinoff, so if I really want to play a game in this style then I'll have a lot to choose from.
