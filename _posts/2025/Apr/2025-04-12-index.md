  title="The Locked Door"
  author="Freida McFadden"
  synopsis="Some doors are locked for a reason… While eleven-year-old Nora Davis was up in her bedroom doing homework, she had no idea her father was killing women in the basement. Until the day the police arrived at their front door. Decades later, Nora’s father is spending his life behind bars, and Nora is a successful surgeon with a quiet, solitary existence. Nobody knows her father was a notorious serial killer. And she intends to keep it that way. Then Nora discovers one of her young female patients has been murdered. In the same unique and horrific manner that her father used to kill his victims. Somebody knows who Nora is. Somebody wants her to take the fall for this unthinkable crime. But she’s not a killer like her father. The police can’t pin anything on her. As long as they don’t look in her basement."

I read this book after reading The Housemaid, since I was still by the pool and wanted some more cheap thriller. I got this book from one of those "take a book, leave a book" cubbies by the pool. I actually enjoyed this one too, maybe my inexperience with this kind of thriller. When we left the resort, I left both this book and The Housemaid in that cubby. These kind of books belong there.
