title: Red Rising
author: Pierce Brown
synopsis: |
  I live for the dream that my children will be born free,' she says. 'That they will be what they like. That they will own the land their father gave them.' 'I live for you,' I say sadly. Eo kisses my cheek. 'Then you must live for more.' Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations. Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children. But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class. Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.

This book was okay. I felt like it was pseudoprofound, or pseudophilosophical, as Pierce Brown has obvioulsy read Plato (something I can detect having read a bunch of Plato last year) and tried to syphon those ideas into these characters. The plot was also a little too borrowed from The Hunger Games, even having a whole arena-style half. I heard the next book is a lot better though, so I'll stick with it.
