title: The Housemaid
author: Freida McFadden
synopsis: |
  Every day I clean the Winchesters’ beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.

  I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew’s handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it’s hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina’s life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband.

  I only try on one of Nina’s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it’s like. But she soon finds out… and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it’s far too late.

  But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don’t know who I really am.

  They don’t know what I’m capable of…

I read this book by the pool. I don't read thrillers often, so this one actually hit for me. My girlfriend said that this book was super obvious, she reads a lot of thrillers. Overall a really good easy popcorn book to read on vacation.
