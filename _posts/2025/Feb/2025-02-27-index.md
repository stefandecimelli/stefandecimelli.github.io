Oh my, this book was amazing. I still in my mind believe that the characters I read are real. I know all of their motivations, weaknesses, and their histories. Every character experienced a physical if not emotional journey throughout the entire book. I was locked in the whole way, reading a chapter or two (our of 102 chapters) each day. Larry writes so well that I could vividly see the town of Lonesome Dove in Texas, and each biome the journey took them to. He was telling be about real people and I genuinely cared about them. When one of them died, I missed them as the characters did. I will probably not experience a story like this ever again in my lifetime. 

I will poupou on something I see in lots of books written in the 20th century. It's something I have a problem with when reading Stephen King. The issue is that it seems like these authors are so excited to include racial slurs and rape scenes in their novels. I honestly think that many books that include rape scenes do not need them, and they are in fact a cheap way to elicit disgust from the reader, and contempt for the characters who carry it out. Similarly for the N word in this book, it seemed like a cheap way to differentiate who is 'good' and who is 'bad', since the good guys respect the Black characters and the bad guys did not. Again, there are ways around this. And to an even smaller degree, it's good that some characters were sensitive to indigenous issues but there was no real virtuous message on the topic.

And yet I still give this book a perfect score, because by all means this book about cowboys, beans, whores, and horses is that good. It is a 5 star book in 2025 as much as it probably was 5 stars forty years ago in 1985.
