Continuing my LeetCode path from my [previous post](/programming/2025/02/03/) I came across three problems that I approached with a double loop (which runs in linearithmic time complexity) and all three hit timeout errors when faced with large data sets. I tried to work on optimizing each of these problems for a minimum of 20 minutes, going through uneven and broken complex attempts, but none of them would work. Eventually, when I look up the solutions from the comments, I realize to achieve linear time, or constant space, I would need to use a specific named algorithm to solve the problem. Of course, these algorithms are tried and tested so I am not down on myself for coming up with a named algorithmic solution all by myself, but now I am starting to wonder if I just need to memorize all of these algorithms to be successful in programming interviews. Blogging about them will help me learn and remember them at least, so I will go through some of the new algorithms I learned and what they may have in common.

## Kadane's Algorithm

This algorithms was used to solve the "[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://github.com/stefandecimelli/Java-Practice-Problems/tree/main/besttimetobuyandsellstock)" problem:
> You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

The Kadane algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a subarray in a data set, and is modified slightly to fit this problem. My original approach was as follows:
```
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    int maxDistance = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < prices.length; j++) {
            int distance = prices[j] - prices[i];
            if (distance > maxDistance) {
                maxDistance = distance;
            }
        }
    }
    return maxDistance;
}
```
Again, this does work, but it runs in linearithmic time which is not good for big data. This is the better linear time algorithm, the modified Kadane's:
```
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
	int buy = prices[0];
	int profit = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
		if (prices[i] < buy) {
			buy = prices[i];
		} else if (prices[i] - buy > profit) {
			profit = prices[i] - buy;
		}
	}
	return profit;
}
```
Interestingly it is not longer or more complex that my original solution, it is just better. You can see we keep a pointer to an index further back in the array, and constantly compare to the new index in the loop. This is a similar theme throughout these algorithms. 

## Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm

This algorithm was used to solve the "[Majority Element](https://github.com/stefandecimelli/Java-Practice-Problems/tree/main/majorityelement)" problem:
> Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Here was my original solution:
```
public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    int majorityElement = nums[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int newVal = 1 + count.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0);

        if (newVal > count.getOrDefault(majorityElement, 0)) {
            majorityElement = nums[i];
            if (newVal >= nums.length) {
                return majorityElement;
            }
        }
        count.put(nums[i], newVal);
    }
    return majorityElement;
}
```
This works too, and it is even pretty good, but it runs in linear storage complexity, whereas this problem can be solved in constant storage complexity. There is no modification of the Boyer-Moore algorithm here, it  works to solve the solution. This algorithm was developed in 1981 to solve this problem, so again I am not upset with myself that I did not come up with it by myself. The optimized code is as follows:
```
public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
	int counter = 0;
	int candidate = 0;
	for (int num : nums) {
		if (counter == 0) { candidate = num; }
		if (num == candidate) { counter++; } else { counter--; }
	}
	return candidate;
}
```
It's insanely simple. It is a greedy algorithm, meaning it makes a bunch of decisions locally that we trust will give us the correct solution in the end. 

## Three Reversal Algorithm

This algorithm was used to solve the "[Rotate Array](https://github.com/stefandecimelli/Java-Practice-Problems/tree/main/rotatearray)" problem:
> Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

This is the simplest of all three problems I worked on in this set of problems. I created a pretty good solution all on my own:
```
public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
    int steps = k % nums.length;
    int[] buffer = new int[steps];
    for (int i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
        buffer[i] = nums[nums.length - steps + i];
    }
    for (int i = nums.length ; i > steps; i--) {
        nums[i - 1] = nums[i - steps - 1];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < buffer.length; i++) {
        nums[i] = buffer[i];
    }
}
```
This uses a buffer memory chunk to hotswap the elements as needed. It is pretty performant and storage cheap. But, there is an algorithm that can make it much more simple without the need of a buffer, completely inline. That is the 'three reversal' algorithm, which simply flips the whole array, then flips each side of the array on either side of k.
```
public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
	int n = nums.length;
	int steps = k % n;
	if (steps == 0) { return; }
	for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) { swap(nums, i, n - i - 1); // Reverse the whole array }
	for (int i = 0; i < steps / 2; i++) { swap(nums, i, steps - i - 1); // Reverse the first K elements }
	for (int i = 0; i < (n - steps) / 2; i++) { swap(nums, i + steps, n - i - 1); // Reverse the rest of the array }
}
```
(Where `swap()` here just uses a temp variable to swap the two elements. This works inline, and well, but surprisingly my own algorithm was a little more performant. 

There are a few things I can learn here but it seems like unless I know and memorize the exact algorithm to solve a problem I will likely be stuck with an unoptimized homemade solution.
