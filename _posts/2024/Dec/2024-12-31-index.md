title: Grasshands
author: Kyle Winkler
synopsis: |
  Everything wrong with the world is wrong with books. When overworked library assistant Sylvia Hix finds a strange moss smothering the books, there’s little to worry about. But when patrons start eating it, gaining direct knowledge of the books, then losing their minds—Sylvia's problems deepen. Moreover, her supervisor is a glue addict, her best friend Albert is growing into a giant, and Clara Gamelin, the Library Board Director, is shaping her to be the next ballbusting head librarian, a job she does not want. Sylvia is haunted by the moss, because it’s connected to a horrific creature from her childhood. A creature she once named Grasshands and has since forgotten. Stopping Grasshands from decaying the town’s minds, the library’s books, and the slow rot of time is the only job now available to her, whether she wants it or not. A novel of biblio-horror, body horror, and melancholic friendship, Grasshands is ready for check-out. Get your library card ready.

Nonsensical, not scary, weird, and not in a good way. The characters were bad without proper motivation and the writing was posh. I didn't like the ending because it felt like fan fiction for a better book. I'm honestly disappointed, since this book was suggested to me by a local horror book store. I am really not into the 'Alice in Wonderland' type nonsense that this book is full of. 
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe my expectations were skewed since the synopsis on the back was not a good representative of the story or the fantastical themes I should have expected. Worst of all the size of the book was awkward and weird. It's a large layout 215 page book when it should have been published smaller to be about 300 pages. Overall a poor reading experience.
