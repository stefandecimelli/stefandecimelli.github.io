Nonsensical, not scary, weird, and not in a good way. The characters were bad without proper motivation and the writing was posh. I didn't like the ending because it felt like fan fiction for a better book. I'm honestly disappointed, since this book was suggested to me by a local horror book store. I am really not into the 'Alice in Wonderland' type nonsense that this book is full of. Maybe my expectations were skewed since the synopsis on the back was not a good representative of the story or the fantastical themes I should have expected. Worst of all the size of the book was awkward and weird. It's a large layout 215 page book when it should have been published smaller to be about 300 pages. Overall a poor reading experience.
