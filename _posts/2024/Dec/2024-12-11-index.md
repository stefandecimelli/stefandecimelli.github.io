A Game of Thrones, the first book of 'A Song of Ice and Fire' was the bane of my existence.
It was soo long and there were far too many characters, houses, and locations to remember.
I also thought it was super slow and unexciting.

All this changed in 'Clash'.
I found that I was able to remember the new characters introduced and recognized the old ones too.
It was a lot less information overload than the first book.
The story was also excellent, with a build to the huge Battle of the Blackwater, and other battles happening in the background. 
Each character (with the exception of maybe Dany, who's story is the weakest in the bunch) had a great ending that sets up so many more possibilities. 

I am a huge fan of this stye of fantasy. 
'Clash' feels like it is a historic blimp in a long and ancient timeline in this universe.
It has interesting characters and amazing dialogue (specifically Tyrion's chapters).
I didn't even mind that it was longer than A Game of Thrones.
