I can't have a blog without talking about gaming.
I've played video games for decades now, starting with the PlayStation 2 and GameBoy Colour consoles.
Eventually I graduated to a PlayStation 3 and a DS.
In high school I built a gaming PC and accrued a huge library of computer games. 
I played soo many video games that I had to cut myself off at one point, selling my PC and focussing on school instead.

Over the years I have played fewer and fewer games, partly by design.
It's natural, people game less when they have more responsibilities.
I came to understand this over the past few years as my gaming time slowly declined and my time focussing on work took over more of my life. 
This is fine with me.
I am reading more, learning more about programming, spending more time family, all things that are needed in a well balanced life. 
But, I would probably have a harder time accepting it when I was younger, and playing waaaay too many PC games. 
I am an adult now, and only have time for a few games a year. 
The good thing about that is with fewer hours to play I need to be more optimal with the quality of games I choose.
If I only play one game per month it should be a good one, I no longer have time to play mid video games.

On PlayStation I played around 16 games total in 2024, and on my Steam Deck I played just a few games off-and-on.
This is a huge difference from 2022, the year I bought a PlayStation 5, where I played and finished a total of 38 games.
That was the peak of my garbage playing, quantity over quality, and not spending enough time doing other types of activities.
I've learned my lesson since.

Here are some notable thoughts and topics from the 16 PlayStation games of this year:

1. I love souls-borne games. I 100% platinumed Bloodborne and Elden Ring this year, and even took a crack at Armored Core VI. I got so addicted to mastering the difficult bosses and the overall gameplay loop of these type of games. Whatever they come out with next -- I'm buying. 
2. I am done with Assassin's Creed and like games. I 100% platinumed Assassin's Creed Mirage, Assassin's Creed III, and Ghost of Tsushima this year. The one thing I can say is that these games are a waste of time, with dull objectives and a pointless story. Ghost of Tsushima is probably the best of these types of games and even that was not enough for me to enjoy myself.
3. Resident Evil is awesome now. I played Resident Evil 4 (remake), 7, and 8 this year and I played them all at least twice. Capcom is doing great things with this franchise and I can't wait to play more.
4. Spider-man 2 was good, pretty OK. Another game I 100% platinumed. But I can't even remember what happened in the story. 
5. Remnant 2 sucked. It is a bad shooter-style rippoff of souls-borne games.
6. Hogwarts Legacy was awsome. Even my partner played it and finished it. A must-have for any Harry Potter fan. 
7. Neon White was really good but I had to skip every line of dialogue so to not cringe to death.
8. Need for Speed Unbound was alright. Same old formula that I enjoy, but I won't play another if they don't iterate on this formula.
9. I will not be buying another EA Sports game after NHL 24. What a nightmare.
10. Shadow of the Colossus is a one-of-a-kind artistic masterpiece.

And some quick thoughts about the Steam games I played:

1. I played Dead Space 1 and 2 this year which was awsome for two reasons. First, the games themselves are awsome. Secondly, I bought these games over a decade ago when I still had my gaming PC. I never played them and so I guess I lost money on them at the time. But here I am now with a Steam deck able to play that huge library of Steam games with my new Steam Deck and that give me a lot of confidence into Steam as a platform.
2. For the first time ever I played Halo. I never had Xbox growing up even though all my friends did, so I missed out on playing Halo 3 online when I was a kid. But now playing Halo on the Steam Deck is a perfect experience. I finished Halo Reach, Halo CE, Halo 2, and I am just starting to play Halo 3 now, all on Hardcore mode.
3. I played a cute indie game called Unpacking. Took me just a few hours to 100 percent it but I enjoyed every minute.
4. I played this rogue-like game called Hades, where the leves are auto-generated. But I found it a bit of a slog. It's super hard and the levels aren't as auto generated as something like 'The Binding of Isaac' and so getting to the final level feels really repetative.

I think I will slowly start gravitating more towards the Steam Deck as my main console.
Using the entire family room TV for my PlayStation will get harder and harder as the number of people in my house grows.
The Steam Deck is also awsome, an amazing console. 
Next year I am super excited to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty, and Death Stranding 2. Maybe Hell is Us will be good too.
