Believe it or not this is not a post about my personal rants and raves about hockey.
The title of this post is actually the name of a book I just finished by Steve 'dangle' Glynn.
Steve has made a whole profession from being a professional hockey fan, and he is specifically crazy about the Leaf's--to be fair who isn't.
I've been watching/reading/listening to Steve for almost 10 years now. 
He has created a whole company serving hockey entertainment online.
Here I'd like to highlight the various sources of Steve's media I consume.

## LFR

LFR stands for Leaf Fan Reaction.
This is the thing that got Steve going. 
For the last 18 years and counting Steve has made a YouTube video reacting to the previous night's Toronto Maple Leaf's game.
Every single game.
This is so impressive, and not just because he was able to do something hundreds and hundreds of times for almost two decades.
Steve is funny, analytical, and brings his own unique insight to the games.
It has become part of my weekly routine to watch the Leaf's and then watch Steve's video the next morning.

## The Steve Dangle Podcast

I've been listening to the podcast almost as long as I've been watching LFRs.
Steve, along with his friends Adam and Jesse, have a podcast show that covers not only the Leaf's, NHL as a whole, but also all kinds of silly stuff.
I even subscribe yearly to them to get more non-hockey related episodes.
It's a great place if you want more of a discussion of hockey games, often expanding on the LFRs. 
I'm a huge fan of these guys, and have even went to go see them live in Port Perry with my brother and friend once.

## His Books

Steve has written two books. 
The latest one is the name of this post which is king of a collection of essays and thoughts from Steve on various hockey topics.
his first book was called "This Team Is Ruining My Life (But I Love Them): How I Became a Professional Hockey Fan".
(Holy long title Batman).
This books was more a self-written bio going through Steve's life and his journey to become a professional hockey fan.
Steve is a good writer and often brings his charm and comedy into his books.
I'll buy and read any book this guy makes, not only to support him, but because I like them.

If you watch Steve, then you're a hockey fan. And a pretty intense one too.
He pours his pain and joy into everything he does. 
Check him out if you want to take your fandom to the next level.
