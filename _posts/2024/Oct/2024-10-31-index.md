I've just launched my new blog where I will post updates about dev stuff, things I learn, or maybe even some fantasy book reviews.
Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefandecimelli/) if you wanna chat about any of my posts!

I think the blog format being used in a github repo actually suites well. I can commit a post, revert it locally if I change my mind, or publish it all with the git cli.
Jekyll and github actions makes it even easier since I don't need to worry about webdev stuff. 
Not that I hate webdev, but it can be really annoying when you want to share a thought and need to edit CSS code. 

The reason I am actually starting this blog is a result of something said on my work's Open Source Coalition call. 
They were talking about personal emminence and building your brand, blogging as one way to do this.
Not all of them recommend blogging, but I liked the idea since I also heard that writing every day, even journaling, can inprove your writing skills.

In conclusion, here's a picture of some cats:
