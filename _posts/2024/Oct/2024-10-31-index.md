I've just launched my new blog where I will post updates about dev stuff, things I learn, or maybe even some fantasy book reviews.
Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefandecimelli/) if you wanna chat about any of my posts!

I think the blog format being used in a github actually suites well. I can commit a post, revert it locally if I change my mind, or publish it all with the git cli.
Jekyll and github actions makes it even easier since I don't need to worry about webdev stuff. 
Not that I hate webdev, but it can be really annoying when you want to share a thought and need to edit CSS code.
