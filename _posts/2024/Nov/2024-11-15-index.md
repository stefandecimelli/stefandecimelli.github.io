synopsis: |
 Now a Hulu series starring Elizabeth Moss. The Handmaid's Tale is an instant classic and eerily prescient cultural phenomenon, from "the patron saint of feminist dystopian fiction" ( New York Times ) The Handmaid’s Tale is a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States and is now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population. The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. The Handmaid’s Tale is funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing. It is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and a tour de force. It is Margaret Atwood at her best.

Just finished my first Margo Atwood book and holy crap, can this lady write. This book was fantastic, and her prose throughout was amazing. The ending was great too, reminding me a lot of "1984" and "Brave New World".

What makes this story unique is how the universe is specifically punishing towards women ("That's the whole point of the book stupid!", I can hear you saying. Yes, don't worry, I know). They are living tools, used solely for the totalitarian Regime's purpose, assigned specific degrading roles, while the men become commanders, agents, or soldiers. I think the most potent metaphor here was the Jezebel. At this secret hotel, the commanding men can indulge in their vices because, as the commander says, "We're only human, after all", which he believes absolves him of all fault. The 'we' in this case though is referring only to men, not even considering the woman around him as human, as a habit or native instinct. Women have nowhere to indulge and be human. The commander genuinely believes that his indulgences are justified, and that he is doing a great service by his handmaid there. But the place is a nightmare; women choosing to prostitute themselves rather than indulge the regime's laws, or die. For them it's about survival.

As a side note, I didn't read this whole book in a day, despite making a `book` post yesterday. I'm usually reading two or three books at a time so my interest and attention is free to shift. I wouldn't be able to read consistently if I forced myself to read only one book at a time, although there have been cases where I have ("Misery", by Stephen King kept my attention the whole way through).

Great book, I recommend everyone read it. I even consider this to be better than "1984" in some ways, and has a superior message about freedom by exploring gender oppression and hypocrisy.
