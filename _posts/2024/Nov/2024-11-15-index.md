Just finished my first Margo Atwood book and holy crap, can this lady write. This book was fantastic, and her prose throughout was amazing. The ending was great too, reminding me a lot of "1984" and "Brave New World".

What makes this story unique is how the universe is specifically punishing towards women ("That's the whole point of the book stupid!", I can hear you saying. Yes, don't worry, I know). They are living tools, used solely for the totalitarian Regime's purpose, assigned specific degrading roles, while the men become commanders, agents, or soldiers. I think the most potent metaphor here was the Jezebel. At this secret hotel, the commanding men can indulge in their vices because, as the commander says, "We're only human, after all", which he believes absolves him of all fault. The 'we' in this case though is referring only to men, not even considering the woman around him as human, as a habit or native instinct. Women have nowhere to indulge and be human. The commander genuinely believes that his indulgences are justified, and that he is doing a great service by his handmaid there. But the place is a nightmare; women choosing to prostitute themselves rather than indulge the regime's laws, or die. For them it's about survival.

As a side note, I didn't read this whole book in a day, despite making a `book` post yesterday. I'm usually reading two or three books at a time so my interest and attention is free to shift. I wouldn't be able to read consistently if I forced myself to read only one book at a time, although there have been cases where I have ("Misery", by Stephen King kept my attention the whole way through).

Great book, I recommend everyone read it. I even consider this to be better than "1984" in some ways, and has a superior message about freedom by exploring gender oppression and hypocrisy.
