Over the past few years I have felt pressure to maintain an online presence centered around my work persona. Most of what I put online, save for this blog and a few secret social media accounts, contributes to the image I display of myself. That includes LinkedIn, GitHub, my internal work profile, all the badges and certificates I earn publicly, and recently this has also included personal websites. I created [www.stefandecimelli.com](https://www.stefandecimelli.com/) in an attempt to not only learn new things but to also serve as a hub for this persona I have cultivated.

The main thing that lead me to making this is simply to learn how to do it. I had experience using the technology stack to build a site like that but I never deployed anything to the internet with a real domain name. I didn't even know how a domain even worked to be honest. My first initial goal was to build the thing and then buy a domain, finding out how to connect the two after those steps. The actual money I spent on the domain encouraged me to keep looking into the project. The site went live and I am super proud of it, especially on my work to make it reactive to mobile displays.

But then I felt the pull of something that I think most programmers and software developers feel; the weight of creating personal projects, or even monetized projects for passive income. The latter to me was far less likely, but the former was doable. I had been dabbling with a few ideas before then and I had an opportunity to build them with some time on my hands.

The first project I built was [www.sinewave.stefandecimelli.com](https://www.sinewave.stefandecimelli.com/), an online chart where you can modify the frequency and magnitude of a sine wave. Super simple, not very helpful, but it was a goal and it had to be accomplished. \
&emsp;The second project was a bit bigger. I created [www.worldquiz.stefandecimelli.com](https://www.worldquiz.stefandecimelli.com/) which is an online game where you need to enter in all the countries of the world in a set amount of time. The idea from this came to me when I was playing similar games elsewhere and had a few things I wanted to change about them. Mainly, I wanted the entire page to show an interactable map. I had to learn a few new concepts for this, mainly about Leaflet, the map provider, and GeoJSON, a way to represent country borders that allow me to highlight countries. This one I was really proud of. \
&emsp;The final was an abandoned project called [www.decihockey.com](https://www.decihockey.com/). You'll notice this one has it's own domain. That's because my goal was to replace [www.capfriendly.com](https://www.capfriendly.com/) which shut down recently this year. I started on this project and got something looking nice, but I realized the mammoth task ahead of me if I wanted to include contract details, and realized why websites like capfriendly kept getting bought. Because programming the logic of a contract is hard work. You need to understand the contract on a fundamental level and then represent that in code, which was a huge task. I am no lawyer and so this project fell through the cracks.

All of these projects, and all future projects are posted in the projects section of my website. I am happy to have done these, but I think if I want to really leave my mark on the internet I need to make something that people are willing to pay money for. I have the technical skill but the hardest part is actually the ideas that can accomplish this. No one will pay for something that doesn't improve their lives and things that improve their lives need to come from good ideas.
