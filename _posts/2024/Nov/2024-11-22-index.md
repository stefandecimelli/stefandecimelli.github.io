I have ceased to comprehend Benjamin Jowett's translation of Plato's complete works as it is written and translated in a dialect that is far too foreign in time to me. So I have chosen to reread what I have already read and continue reading Plato's complete works but switching to the edition: Hackett Pub Co Inc; UK ed. edition (May 1 1997). In reading the first dialogue in this Collection, Euthyphro, I already notice how much easier it is to understand. In addition, this copy is free of many spelling and grammar issues from the copy of Jowett's translation (that's what I get for buying a 4000 page kindle ebook for 99 cents).

Euthyphro was probably the first dialogue that I enjoyed throughout. I thought it displayed the Socratic method in it's most clear form as Socrates meets a man, Euthyphro, who claims to hold absolute knowledge of piety and impiety, and Socrates, the troublemaker, jumps in excitement that he may become this man's student, himself of course knowing 'nothing' about what is pious and impious. A clear road to Socratic irony.

My favourite fallacy that Socrates finds is when they are discussing what 'all' gods love, in order to define pious, and then symmetrically what is impious. Euthyphro says that a thing is pious because it is loved by the gods. Socrates asked if it is pious because it is loved by the gods, or if the gods love it because it is pious. Because here is the fallacy, how can something be loved because it is loved. This is an endless loop of logical recursion. The gods love it because it is pious, and it is pious because the gods love it, and why do the gods love it? because it is pious.

The next dialogue in the order of the Hackett edition is apology, which I have already read and created a [post](https://stefandecimelli.github.io/books/2024/11/14) about. I will still re-read it but abstain from posting again to this blog about the same thing. In that case, the next post based on the writings of Plato will be from Phaedo, which will probably take me some time to read. 

I am also dreading the thought that I might lose interest. I do this all the time, where I am super committed to learning something for days on end, and then I suddenly lose interest in a split second. A prime example of this was when I tried to learn Latin. I read Latin text and studied on Duolingo for 75 days straight, even buying physical copies of textbooks, only to one day lose all interest out of nowhere. I'm a serial hobbiest. Hopefully my attention can be fixated on this Plato endeavour for the next year or so, as there is a LOT of reading coming my way.
