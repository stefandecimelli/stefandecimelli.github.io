At the risk of sounding more pompous and pretentious than ever, I have started to read into Plato's complete works, starting with his four dialogues: Apology of Socrates, Crito, Phaedo, and Protagoras.

Like most classics and philosophy books I usually need to read an analysis and watch some YouTube videos to better understand the deeper meanings of this stuff. Specifically I am reading Benjamin Jowett's translation of these and he does a good summary and analysis of each dialogue. But I do need to consult the internet still for the actual points to think on. 

Though, there were a few ideas that did spark my thinking without assistance and I think these are noteworthy:

1. Socrates' notion of "fear of death". He constantly states how he is not scared to be put to death because he knows not if death is 'good' or 'bad'. That's a cool way to think about it. Even further, he says that someone who lived a good and virtuous life has nothing to fear in death  because it is one of two things: (1) a good long sleep which we are all familiar with, or (2) a transportation of our soul to a realm in which we can be judged for the virtue that we do have. 

2. Socrates' travels to find one person who may be wiser than he is, only to discover that there was none who did not pretend even a little like they knew more than they knew. And, especially the experts and the artists, believed that they were wise and knowledgeable about things they didn't know anything about. It is interesting to me because his notion of wisdom is founded on one core belief, that he knows nothing. And anyone who claims to know something will never be able to fully claim that they understand it according to him. Now, it does come off as arrogant, especially when Socrates states that this gift of wisdom was given to him by the gods, but there is a morsel of truth in there. My takeaway is that only those who admit that there is more to learn about something have wisdom about it. Wise is not intelligence, or rote knowledge. This is not a new thought exactly, I've heard many times that you must admit to know nothing to be considered a "smart person", but I don't think I connected the dot that this notion came from Socrates. 

Point two especially brings up somethign I have been thinkling of for a while. There is no such thing as "smart" or a "smart person". What does that even mean? Is someone who memorizes pi to 100 digits smart? How are they smarter than someone who can cook a complex dish, or someone like Connor McDavid who reach the pinacle of human hockey skill? Is a chess grandmaster smart the same way a physicist is smart? I think there needs to be a referendum on this word "smart". What I think people mean by "that person is smart" is actually one of two things: (1) that person has a lot of experience in a subject or skill, or (2) that person is an effective learner and applies what he knows. I think we need to release this idea that there is this one metric, "smart", in which everyone can be weighed by. We are all building pillars of experience. All of our pillars are unique, and some can build faster than others. If one person spend 10 years memorizing pi to 100 digits, and someone else spends 2 years memorizing to 50 digits, who is smarter? Surely the second person learns faster but the first person knows more. How can we possibly say that the second person is smarter? What if the first person struggles with memorization but is a very skilled chemist. Who is smarter now? All this to say, we should not comare ourselves with others. I am not smarter that you, and you are not smarter than me. Smart doesn't exist, and at the end of the day it doesn't even matter. Okay tangent over.

The next dialogue on the list is Charmides. I have no idea what this is, and I have never heard of it. Lets see what wacky thing it makes me think up. The order I am taking to read through all of Plato's works is the order of the "Plato Complete Works" kindle ebook, which starts with the early socratic dialogues, the last days of socrates, Gorgias, and Protagoras. Maybe I'll asbsorb a molecule of something throughout this process, but I have no certainty that I am not wasting my time.

Anyways, I'll post this and not look back, pretending like my backspace button doesn't work. That's the whole point of a blog anyways.
