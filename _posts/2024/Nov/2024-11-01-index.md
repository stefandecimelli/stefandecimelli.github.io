Was able to go to the Maple Leafs game last night. 4-1 win against the Kraken.
Honestly it was a super fun game to go to. Our tickets were in the corner nosebleeds but they were free given by a relative so I will never complain about that.

Seeing Nylander do his thing is a treat, he's the best player on the team this year... so far (and arguably last year too).

In other news, I just got kicked out of 1st in my fantasy league. One member of the 6-person league dropped Vasilevskiy (by accident?) and I was too slow to pick him up.
Now, first place has Vasilevskiy and Hellebuyck (AND McDavid). So I guess it's game over.

This feels like a pretty procedural post for a blog. 
I am trying this thing out as I go, and so I may or may not adhere to some code about it all.
Right now, I just wanted to talk about hockey, so I made a hockey post.
I catagorized this into a `hockey` tag, but does this spiel at the end make it a `meta` post?
I'll figure that stuff out as I go.
This bog is for me.
If there is some psycho out there who somehow likes reading my posts then they would be liking something that I enjoy doing for myself. 
And then I won't need to do anything more to buy that psycho's loyalty or attention. 
Best case scenario, I host an army of psychos and we do some fight club stuff.


I'll try to post once a day, and no more.
I have a script setup that helps me with these posts and it will block more than one markdown page per day.
No matter how itchy I am to splatter text all over the internet.
