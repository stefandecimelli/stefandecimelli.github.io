Was able to go to the Maple Leafs game last night. 4-1 win against the Kraken.
Honestly it was a super fun game to go to. Our tickets were in the corner nosebleeds but they were free given by a relative so I will never complain about that.

Seeing Nylander do his thing is a treat, he's the best player on the team this year... so far (and arguably last year too).

In other news, I just got kicked out of 1st in my fantasy league. One member of the 6-person league dropped Vasilevskiy (by accident?) and I was too slow to pick him up.
Now, first place has Vasilevskiy and Hellebuyck (AND McDavid). So I guess it's game over.
