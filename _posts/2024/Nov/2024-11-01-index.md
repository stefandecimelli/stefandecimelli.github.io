Was able to go to the Maple Leafs game last night. 4-1 win against the Kraken.
Honestly it was a super fun game to go to. Our tikets were in the corner nosebleeds but they were free given by a relative so I will never complain about that.

Seeing Nylander do his thing is a treat, he's the best player on the team this year so far (and arguably last year).
