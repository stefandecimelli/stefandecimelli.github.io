Charmides is a very confusing dialogue. It is plagued with ramblings and specifics that muddle the nature of the conversation between Socrates, Charmides, and Critas, about temperance (in the ancient Greek sense, not the modern definition), and what it really means. Socrates has this way of granular thinking that gets so abstract in search of the truth that it gets extremely hard to follow. Then, they slap you in the face by saying that if you [Charmides] already live with perfect temperance and virtue then you should just carry on and ignore Socrates as if he is a rambling fool. Because trying to ascertain the definition of a virtue when one already contains this virtue wholly will not accomplish anything of value.

I think in this dialogue too, Plato uses this character Charmides as a symbolic person, rather than a real one. Charmides is perfect in looks, virtue, manner, and we learn as well, temperance. I think too that, temperance in the ancient Greek sense, being something that is always good and never bad, is something that you channel and not something that can be defined. Which perhaps makes the final slap of 'ignore me, carry on' the final lesson here. We cannot define what good is.

I'd like to append that by saying 'you cannot define what good is; you know it when you do it' but that is not true. In the muddle of attempts to become specific of the concept they wonder about the science of science, and if this can help define wisdom and temperance. Is wisdom the conjugation of what we know _and_ what we do not know? But they arrive at the conclusion that this is preposterous, since one cannot know what they don't know and therefore they cannot know if their actions and behaviors are good. Therefore, this is not temperance, since temperance is always good. This notion is enhanced by the fact that Critas becomes, in ancient Greek lore, one of the thirty tyrants. The inclusion of Critas in this dialogue could be Plato's way of ensuring this notion. (I am a firm believer that these dialogues were scenarios meant to show Socrates' philosophy within the scenario, and not actual historical accounts).

This is my, a green 20-something year old guy's take on this dialogue. I have no doubt that if I come back to this in ten years that I will have a completely different outlook on the whole situation -- hopefully with a better understanding of the nuances.
