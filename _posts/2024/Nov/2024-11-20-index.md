Against my will, I have always programmed in Java (except for a few years where I was trapped in a DevOps role).
I learned Java in high school with [`Ready to Program with Java`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ready+to+Program+with+Java%22), then in University I learned more Java in "CISC 124 Intro. to Computing Science II". 
During my internship I worked with Java to create test and delivery automation systems.
I got hired out of that internship, and so I never had to do an interview.
And now for my job I write JAX-RS endpoints, JUnit tests, and design concurrent API fetching systems.  

All this to say, I never did the 'proper' Java interview that a software developer usually does (though I am no stranger to interviews).
But given that I use Java full time in my current role I am deciding to choose Java, and choosing to buy into it and learn more about it. 
Some of that learning includes interview questions, stuff I should know, such as "**what is the difference between a hash map and a concurrent hash map**".
Senior java engineers are able to answer this, and interviewees have likely studied this question. \
&emsp; I did not know how to properly answer this question, although I have a faint idea of how the two work from experience using them.
I want to fix that, and learn everything Java, and so I start here.
I got the job already, so let me work backwards and figure out what I need to know to pass the interview for my job.

The first thing I learned is that java hash maps internally are an array of linked list with an initial size of 16, called 16 buckets, with each bucket being a linked list.
The hash map resizes itself it more objects need to be added.
> I am beginning to learn that memory-safe languages do need to use specific memory sizes, even though it may not look like it.
Usually they specify a specific size then resize if needed. The garbage collector cleans up this memory after it is no longer used.

The nodes on these linked lists are `key`, `value`, `hash`, `next`. The hash value is how the hash map decides which bucket to place the linked list: 
```
put(key, value):
  if key == null:
    index = n-1 // index of null always gets placed in the index:0 bucket
  else
    hash = hashingAlgo(key)
    index = hash & (n-1)
  insert the value into the linked list at index
``` 
This way, if there are n elements in the map, then the worst case scenario complexity is O(n) for fetches, in the unlikely instance where all n element keys compute to the same hash. 
The best case scenario would be O(1) which is where all hash values are unique and are all placed in their own bucket. 
Java 8 expands on this by converting the linked list into a balanced-tree, if there are too many objects in one bucket.

A hash map is not thread-safe. When used in a multithreaded program it needs to be wrapped in a `synchronized` block to prevent data corruption, infinite loops during resizing, and other unexpected behavior.
Synchronizing all operations on a hash map is not performant and prone to human error. 
This is why a concurrent hash map should be used in a multithreaded program.
It adds fine grained locking on the bucket level (as of Java 8) for the added ability to read and write to the map concurrently.
The trade-off is performance (slightly), with the overhead of the locking, and is slower overall in single-threaded or low-concurrency reads and writes.

5 years into my career, I should have know this already.
But, I haven't decided to fully commit to Java until about last year when I got into my new job, and so obviously I am late to the party.
Hopefully over the next few years of learning I can get to a point where I know more than the people interviewing for the job I have.
